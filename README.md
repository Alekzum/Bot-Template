## Description
This is just a template for future bots on Python with `aiogram`

## Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Make your bot (aka "add your scripts in handlers, file common.py as example")
3. Run `main.py`. Program will auto-create directory `.venv`, install packages from file `requirements.txt`, and run `main.py` with that virtual environment.
4. Write a bot token from the [BotFather](https://botfather.t.me) bot.
